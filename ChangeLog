Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.1
* Add new vdifmux function which takes a multi-threaded VDIF buffer, looks
  for frames with certain threadIds, and multiplexes them into a single-
  threaded output buffer.
* New programs exercising new library routines:
  - vsum       summarize contents of 1 or more VDIF files
  - vmux       multiplex a multi-thread VDIF file into a single-thread file
* New utilities (mirroring functionality of mark5access utilities):
  - vdifd      (m5d)
  - vdifbstate (m5bstate)
  - vdiffold   (m5fold)
  - vdifspec   (m5spec)
* Other new utilities
  - extractVDIFThreads: gets only packets corresponding to given thread IDs
* Inlinification and constification of many VDIF header access functions
* Large file clean (I think) now...
* Fix bugs in multi2singlethreadVDIF which caused crashes if many packets missing
