Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.4
* Added incrementVDIFHeader
* Added ctypes-based Python bindings and one example (vdifio_1.py)
* vsum: error message -> stderr, not stdout
* Support new EDV2 that is produced by ALMA and R2DBE.  Work here is based on spec with TBDs: http://vlbi.org/vdif/docs/alma-vdif-edv.pdf
* New functionality in printVDIFheader:
  - Add Mark6 awareness:  If the Mark6 signature is found at the beginning, 28 bytes will be skipped to allow proper decoding.
  - If framesize is not provided at the command line, take from first frame
* New functionality in vmux
  - Support multiplexing multi-channel multi-thread data (each thread must have same general parameters)
* testmk6: test/example program for mark6 reading capabilities.  Does simple gather operation and file summary at this point.
* changes to multiplexing: increase max number of threads to mux to 64, warn if too many threads are being muxed, move out cornerturners to their own file.
  - note: ABI change.  Recompile of all code using vdifio is needed after updating to this version
* change a few key variables from "long long" to "int64_t" 
* cornerturners now all use sized integers for variables that care
* new corner turners:
  - 1-bit with 16 threads		(slow and convoluted; likely possible to do better)
  - 4-bit with 16 threads
  - 16-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - 32-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - 64-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - Why need for large words?  It turns out that multiplexing multiple channels per thread is mathematically identical to multiplexing one channel per thread but with a total bit width of nBit*nChan
* VDIF multiplexer now supports multiplexing threads with more than one channel.
  - a change in the API for configurevdifmux() is likely coming that will simplify use of this.  For now, use setvdifmuxinputchannels() after configurevdifmux()
* New utility: filterVDIF.  It extracts certain threads and summarized what it found.  Similar to extractVDIFThreads.
* New utility: mk6gather: reads a VDIF stream from a Mark6 unit and writes it to a file.  Time reordering is done at the packet level.
* New utility: mk6ls: lists Mark6 "files" on system.  Respects ENV VAR MARK6_ROOT

Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
* ******* NOTE CHANGES TO THE API *********
* Changed parameter in createVDIFHeader (pass size of dataarray not full
	VDIF frame).
* Changed function of getVDIFEpoch and setVDIFFrameSecond
* Renamed:
	getVDIFMJD
	getVDIFFrameFullSecond -> getVDIFFrameEpochSecOffset
	setVDIFFrameSecond -> setVDIFFrameEpochSecOffset
	setVDIFFrameFull
	setVDIFMJDSec -> setVDIFFrameMJDSec
	getVDIFDMJD -> getVDIFFrameDMJD
	setVDIFTime -> setVDIFFrameTime (and changed functionality)
	setVDIFEpoch -> setVDIFEpochMJD
* Added
	getVDIFFrameMJDSec
	setVDIFEpochTime
* Added new utility printVDIFgaps to examine a VDIF stream for missing data
* vdifmux now fed by a structure.  This allows for safer, faster and more flexible muxing.
* printVDIFheader: when legacy data don't print any EDV info
* multi2singlethreadVDIF: fixed bug where frames with invalid bit set had zero epoch and wrong seconds
* captureUDPVDIF: properly use skipbytes at the front and back of the packet
* Version for DiFX-2.4, Nov 4, 2014

Version 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.3
* Expose getVDIFEpochMJD: returns integer MJD corresponding to start of VDIF epoch
* Add printVDIFheader which will also print contents of EDV1 and EDV3 

Version 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fix the 2-bit 16 thread case in the vdifmux function
* 1-bit corner turners now supported: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 threads
* 2-bit corner turners now supported: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 threads
* 4-bit corner turners now supported: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 threads
* 8-bit corner turners now supported: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 threads
* add corner turn test program: testcornerturners
* add function to decode data from a single frame of VDIF data
* add utility to convert from 2-bit to 8-bit VDIF data (perhaps useful for testing)
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add new vdifmux function which takes a multi-threaded VDIF buffer, looks
  for frames with certain threadIds, and multiplexes them into a single-
  threaded output buffer.
* New programs exercising new library routines:
  - vsum       summarize contents of 1 or more VDIF files
  - vmux       multiplex a multi-thread VDIF file into a single-thread file
* New utilities (mirroring functionality of mark5access utilities):
  - vdifd      (m5d)
  - vdifbstate (m5bstate)
  - vdiffold   (m5fold)
  - vdifspec   (m5spec)
* Other new utilities
  - extractVDIFThreads: gets only packets corresponding to given thread IDs
* Inlinification and constification of many VDIF header access functions
* Large file clean (I think) now...
* Fix bugs in multi2singlethreadVDIF which caused crashes if many packets missing
* Version for DiFX-2.2, May 31, 2013

Version 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 4, 2012

Version 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.0.0
* Ability to make RPM files
* Version for DiFX-2.0.1, June 10, 2011

Version 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Initial implementation of vdifio
* Serves multiple VDIF threads from one source to multiple sinks
* Version for DiFX-2.0.0
